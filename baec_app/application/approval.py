"""The human confirmation gate.

A request grants nothing. Only the trusted human-interaction adapter calls
approve(), and only in response to an explicit human action; the gate then
issues exactly one HumanApproval for that request. A command redeems the
approval once, and receives the stored request content, never content
supplied by the caller.

_GATE_KEY is private to this module. HumanApproval refuses any other key, so
only HumanConfirmationGate constructs approvals. This is accident resistance,
not a security boundary: code running in this process can still reach
private names.

All gate state is in memory and guarded by one lock. Every check-and-mutate
sequence runs under that lock, so redemption validates and consumes
atomically.
