"""SQLite connection, schema, versioning, and transactions.

This module knows table shapes and nothing about BAEC meaning. Decisions
stay in the domain layer; conversion between rows and objects is in
repository.py.

STRICT tables stop a column from holding the wrong storage type. They are a
backstop only: repository serialization and fail-closed rehydration through
the domain constructors remain the authority on what stored data means.
