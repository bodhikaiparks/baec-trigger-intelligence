"""Engine 2 persistence and audit history (Stage D): a separate, append-only SQLite store.

This store is isolated from Engine 1. It is a different database file with
its own schema (engine BAEC_ENGINE_2, schema version 1); it never opens,
reads, or writes the Engine 1 database, and Engine 1 identifiers (BAEC,
confirmation, currentness record) are stored as opaque references only.

Persistence adapts to the locked Stage C domain, never the reverse:

* every write takes validated domain objects, and every read rebuilds them
  through the domain constructors, so Stage C validation runs again on load
  (content hashes, Derived Measurement recomputation, review consistency);
* authoritative rows are append-only: triggers refuse UPDATE, DELETE, and any
  insert that would collide with an existing key, and there is no delete API;
* a duplicate identifier is refused (DuplicateRecordError), never replaced;
* the correspondence outcome is stored only as a snapshot computed here by the
  Stage C classifier, recomputed on every load, and refused on any mismatch.
  No function accepts an outcome;
* each write is one transaction with its audit event: all of it, or none;
* every timestamp is supplied by the caller; nothing reads the clock;
* a Monitoring Plan is identified by (monitoring_plan_id, plan_version). Each
  version is immutable; activation, source authorization, evidence, candidates,
  and reviews bind to one exact version, and composite keys forbid mixing them.

It interprets no source text, performs no AI reasoning, accesses no source,
and takes no seller action.
