"""Engine 1 adapter: the console's structured capture form, turned into the real Engine 1 objects.

Nothing here classifies a BAEC or decides an account state. The adapter builds the locked domain objects
(SourceInteraction, BaecCandidate, EvidenceExcerpt, StringencyExpression, ...) from what the salesperson typed,
and every authoritative write goes through the Phase 4 HumanCommandFacade: request, then the gate's approval
in response to the salesperson's click, then the approval-only command. The locked classifier and state
machine decide; the console only shows what they decided.

Form rules that are stricter than the domain (implementation choices of this console, not research rules):

* every evidence excerpt must be copied exactly from the interaction. Text inside the buyer's exact statement
  is recorded as BUYER_FACT; text inside the seller notes is recorded as SELLER_OBSERVATION;
* threshold wording and timing wording must appear verbatim in the buyer's exact statement (RC-18).
