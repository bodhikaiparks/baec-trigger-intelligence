# Phase 6C Live Evaluation (C-C1: harness and corpus)

**Project:** BAEC Trigger Intelligence
**Baseline:** Phase 6C-B, commit `f5875bc`.
**Status:** **No live execution has occurred.** No Anthropic request has been made. The harness, corpus, and gates are in place for review.

These evaluations measure the implementation and model behavior on synthetic cases. They do not validate BAEC theory, show prospective validity, or produce a BAEC quality score.

---

## 1. Provider transport settings (locked)

| Setting | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Timeout | **180 seconds** (`ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 180.0`) | `baec_app/ai/anthropic_provider.py`, set on the client as `Anthropic(max_retries=0, timeout=180.0)` |
| Retries | **`max_retries=0`**: one AiRun is one HTTP attempt | same |

- The timeout is transport configuration. It is not part of `AiRequestSpec`, `request_digest`, `prompt_digest`, `input_digest`, `output_schema_digest`, or any run provenance.
- An injected client must carry exactly these two settings, or the provider refuses it.
- A timeout still maps to `transport_failure` / `timeout_or_disconnect` / `unknown`.

## 2. The live gate

A live run happens only if **every** condition holds:

1. **Explicit selection.** The test is selected explicitly with `-m live_claude`. The default `pytest` run deselects it (`pytest.ini`: `addopts = … -m "not live_claude"`), even if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BAEC_LIVE_CLAUDE`, and `BAEC_LIVE_MODEL` are all set.
2. **The live flag.** `BAEC_LIVE_CLAUDE=1`, exactly.
3. **An explicit model.** `BAEC_LIVE_MODEL` is set to exactly `claude-sonnet-5-5` or `claude-opus-5-5`. There is no default model. This restriction belongs to the comparison harness only; the production service has no model allow-list.
4. **Authentication.** SDK authentication is configured in the environment. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is checked for presence only. The value is never read out, printed, persisted, or passed as `api_key=`.

If any condition fails, the test skips with a generic message that contains no environment value.

## 3. Exact commands (not yet run)

Run from the repository root with the project environment active, one model per invocation:

```
BAEC_LIVE_CLAUDE=1 BAEC_LIVE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5-5 python -m pytest tests/live/test_live_extraction.py -m live_claude -s -p no:cacheprovider
```

```
BAEC_LIVE_CLAUDE=1 BAEC_LIVE_MODEL=claude-opus-5-5 python -m pytest tests/live/test_live_extraction.py -m live_claude -s -p no:cacheprovider
```

No `addopts` override is needed: an explicit `-m live_claude` on the command line replaces the default `-m "not live_claude"` (verified with `--collect-only`).

The first comparison is **one call per case per model**: 14 Sonnet calls and 14 Opus calls, 28 in total. There are no repeated or stochastic trials, and the count is never increased automatically.

## 4. What a run does

1. **Gate.** The gate opens (§2).
2. **Corpus validation.** The corpus is validated before any database or provider exists (§5).
3. **Fresh database.** A temporary directory (`baec-live-eval-*`, under the system temp location) holds a new schema-v5 database containing only the corpus fixtures. Every AI table starts empty. `var/baec_dev.sqlite3` and other long-lived databases are never used.
4. **Authority snapshot.** Every authoritative (non-AI) table is snapshotted on a query-only connection.
5. **Cases run serially.** Each case runs through the **unchanged production stack**: `open_extraction_runtime(...)` with the real `AnthropicExtractionProvider`, the canonical input, prompt v1, the request spec, the run persisted before the attempt, one provider attempt, strict parsing, semantic validation, and atomic terminal and artifact persistence. Each terminal outcome is persisted before the next call. Nothing runs in parallel. An unexpected local exception during a case is recorded as status `incomplete` (or `not_started` if no run row exists) with only its class name, and the remaining cases still run. Nothing is retried.
6. **Authority re-check.** The authority tables are compared with the snapshot. Only the five AI provenance tables may have gained rows. Any change is the critical failure `authority_mutation`.
7. **Cleanup.** The temporary database is deleted.

The run asserts only infrastructure invariants: authority unchanged, every case attempted, and no provenance failure. Model behavior is reported, not asserted. Operational validity (§7.1) is reported in the aggregate.

## 5. Corpus `baec-extraction-live-corpus/v1`

- **Location:** `tests/live/data/baec_extraction_live_v1.json`.
- **Synthetic only.** It is entirely fictional: no real company, buyer, salesperson, customer, CRM record, pricing agreement, or personal information. Interactions use roles (`Buyer:`, `Seller:`) and generic product categories.
- **Naming convention.** Identifiers follow `ACC-SYN-Cnn` and `INT-SYN-Cnn`.
- **Each case has:** `case_id`, `account_id`, `interaction_id`, `interaction_text`, `criticality` (`critical` | `standard`), `checks`, and an informational `purpose`.
- **No expected model JSON is stored.** Checks evaluate behavioral properties.

**Validation, before anything runs:**
- the exact version;
- 1–18 cases;
- unique case, account, interaction, and check IDs;
- synthetic ID patterns;
- non-blank text;
- known criticality, check types, check kinds, and critical classes;
- exactly the required parameters for each check;
- no URLs, file references, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, key-like or long opaque values;
- no unknown fields.

## 6. Checks: hard versus observational

**Core hard checks** apply to every case:

| Check | Critical class | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CORE-PROVENANCE | provenance_failure | Every record the terminal status requires exists, loads, and verifies (status-aware; see below) |
| CORE-VERBATIM | fabricated_evidence | No `excerpt_not_verbatim`, `excerpt_blank`, or `source_interaction_mismatch` |
| CORE-NUMBERS | threshold_corruption | Every number in a normalization appears in the source text |

**CORE-PROVENANCE is status-aware.** It verifies persistence and integrity, not model behavior:
- The run must load, and a terminal result must exist and load.
- If the result records an output digest, the raw output must exist and verify against it (the 6B output rules decide which statuses carry output).
- `success` additionally requires the artifact and all its excerpts, loaded with verified digests and bindings.
- Every other terminal status (`refusal`, `max_tokens`, `unexpected_stop`, `parse_failure`, `semantic_validation_failure`, `api_error`, `transport_failure`, `model_mismatch`, `interrupted`) must have **no** artifact. A missing artifact there is expected and passes.

It fails only on a real persistence, integrity, or infrastructure failure: success without an artifact, a run with no terminal result, a missing required output, a corrupted digest, a broken binding, an artifact on a non-success status, or a record that cannot be loaded. A refusal is therefore a behavioral outcome, not a provenance failure, and an `api_error` or `transport_failure` with a correctly persisted result passes CORE-PROVENANCE (it is handled by operational validity, §7.1).

**Semantics:**
- Checks that need an artifact fail when there is none.
- Prohibitions (`analysis_status_not`, `criterion_not_supported`, `no_criterion_supported`, `excerpt_fragment_requires`, `fragment_speaker_not`, `normalization_forbids`, `supporting_excerpts_exclude`, and the core checks) pass when nothing was claimed.
- Observational checks are reported and never affect eligibility.
- Ambiguous cases do not force one analysis status: those expectations are observational.

## 7. Comparison doctrine (locked before any result is known)

### 7.1 Operational validity comes first

A model's run is **operationally invalid** if any case has:
- `api_error`, `transport_failure`, `model_mismatch`, or `interrupted`;
- an incomplete run or no terminal result (`incomplete`, `not_started`);
- a CORE-PROVENANCE (persistence or integrity) failure;
- or the run changed an authoritative table.

If **either** model's run is operationally invalid, the comparison result is **defer** with reason `operationally_inconclusive`, before eligibility or ranking is considered. Nothing overrides this: not hard checks passed, artifacts, tokens, or elapsed time. Nothing is retried automatically; a re-run needs a new explicit approval.

`refusal`, `max_tokens`, `unexpected_stop`, `parse_failure`, and `semantic_validation_failure` are **behavioral** outcomes. They do not make a run operationally invalid; they are judged by the case checks below.

### 7.2 Eligibility and ranking (operationally valid runs only)

A model is **ineligible** to become the default if it has any critical failure:
- fabricated or non-verbatim source evidence;
- threshold comparator corruption;
- negation reversal;
- following instructions in source text as authority;
- production provenance failure;
- a schema or parse failure on a clear valid case;
- an authoritative table changing during the run.

Among eligible models:
1. compare hard checks passed;
2. compare successful, semantically valid artifacts;
3. report tokens and elapsed time descriptively. They never rank and never outweigh a correctness gap.

If the eligible models are tied on (1) and (2), the result is **defer**: both are carried forward to Phase 6D and no winner is manufactured. The comparison informs a human decision; it never sets a default model. There is no numeric BAEC quality score.

## 8. Console output

**Per case:** model, corpus version, case ID, ai_run_id, terminal status, artifact present (yes/no), hard checks passed out of total, failed check IDs, elapsed seconds, input tokens, output tokens, and for an unexpected local failure only the exception class name (`error=<ClassName>`).

**Aggregate:** calls attempted, successful artifacts, hard checks passed and failed, critical failure classes, whether authority was unchanged, whether the run is operationally valid and which operational failures occurred, total input and output tokens, total elapsed seconds.

**Never printed:** the API key, environment contents, the prompt, a provider response, thinking, interaction text, or a traceback for an expected provider error. Diagnostics use case IDs, check IDs, and machine codes.

## 9. Results

**NOT RUN — awaiting explicit approval.**
