"""The Phase 6C live comparison run. Opt-in only; it never runs in the default test suite.

It is deselected by default (pytest.ini adds -m "not live_claude"), and even when
selected it skips unless the live gate is open (see tests/live/harness.py and
docs/PHASE6C_LIVE_EVALUATION.md). Run one model per invocation, for example:

    BAEC_LIVE_CLAUDE=1 BAEC_LIVE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5-5 BAEC_LIVE_REPORT_DIR=/absolute/ignored/or/external/dir \\
        python -m pytest tests/live/test_live_extraction.py -m live_claude -s -p no:cacheprovider

Since Phase 6D-C1 the gate also requires BAEC_LIVE_REPORT_DIR (tests/live/report.py), checked before any
provider attempt, and the run writes one sanitized baec-live-evaluation-report/v1 file there.
